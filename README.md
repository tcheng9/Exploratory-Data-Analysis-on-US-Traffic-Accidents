# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-US-Traffic-Accidents

This is an exploratory data analysis(EDA) on the US traffic accidents dataset found on Kaggle. This was my first EDA so I tried to get a general sense of the data and find things I was interested in such as accidents by points of interests and where accidents occured on a US map. This was an initial look at the dataset which took me longer than I would like to admit. 

In the future, I may return to the dataset to allow for more predictive power through regression analysis to predict accidents by year.


Things to improve on:

-Cleanliness of code: 
    Variables should be cleaner as there are certain things that I don't remember what it was for and too lazy to fix.
-Efficiency of EDA:
    The EDA took longer than I would have liked and got stuck at certain points where I wish I had solved quicker.
-Deeper statistical analysis:
    I want to further my understanding statistics and apply more rigorous statistical analysis in the future.
